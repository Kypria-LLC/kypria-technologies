# Security Policy

## Overview

This security policy outlines the procedures for reporting vulnerabilities and security concerns in the Kypria Technologies repository. We are committed to maintaining the security and integrity of our automation infrastructure.

## Supported Versions

We currently support security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Automated Security Scanning

This repository is configured with automated security scanning tools:

- **Dependabot**: Automatically monitors and alerts on vulnerable dependencies
- **CodeQL**: Performs automated security analysis on code commits
- **Secret Scanning**: Detects accidentally committed secrets and credentials

### Manual Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it through one of the following channels:

#### 1. GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)

1. Navigate to the Security tab of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the advisory form with details:
   - Vulnerability description
   - Affected components
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested remediation

#### 2. Email Reporting

For sensitive disclosures that should not be publicly tracked:

- Email: security@kypria.tech
- Subject: [SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - [Brief Description]
- Include: Detailed description, reproduction steps, and impact assessment

#### 3. Automated Issue Creation

For non-critical security concerns:

1. Create a new issue with the "security" label
2. Use the security issue template
3. Provide detailed information about the concern

## Response Timeline

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Initial Acknowledgment | Within 48 hours |
| Initial Assessment | Within 5 business days |
| Status Update | Every 7 days until resolution |
| Fix Development | Depends on severity (see below) |
| Public Disclosure | After fix deployment + 7 days |

## Severity Levels and Response Times

### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- **Response Time**: Immediate (within 24 hours)
- **Fix Target**: Within 48 hours
- **Examples**: Remote code execution, authentication bypass, data breach

### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- **Response Time**: Within 48 hours
- **Fix Target**: Within 7 days
- **Examples**: Privilege escalation, SQL injection, XSS

### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- **Response Time**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Target**: Within 30 days
- **Examples**: Information disclosure, CSRF, weak cryptography

### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- **Response Time**: Within 10 business days
- **Fix Target**: Within 90 days
- **Examples**: Security misconfigurations, outdated dependencies

## Automation and CI/CD Security

### Pipeline Security

Our automation pipelines implement the following security measures:

1. **Branch Protection**: Main branch is protected with required reviews
2. **Status Checks**: All CI checks must pass before merging
3. **Secret Management**: All secrets are stored in GitHub Secrets
4. **Least Privilege**: Automation tokens have minimal required permissions
5. **Build Isolation**: Each build runs in an isolated environment

### Deployment Security

- All deployments require successful security scans
- Production deployments require manual approval
- Rollback procedures are tested and documented
- Post-deployment verification is automated

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Contributions

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables or GitHub Secrets
2. **Validate inputs**: Always sanitize and validate user inputs
3. **Use dependencies wisely**: Only add necessary dependencies from trusted sources
4. **Follow secure coding guidelines**: Refer to OWASP Top 10
5. **Run security checks locally**: Use pre-commit hooks and local scanners

### Dependency Management

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review Dependabot alerts promptly
- Audit new dependencies before adding them
- Use dependency pinning for reproducible builds

### Secret Management

- Never hardcode credentials
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Rotate secrets regularly (at least quarterly)
- Revoke unused tokens and credentials immediately

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask security researchers to:

1. **Allow time for fixes**: Give us reasonable time to address issues before public disclosure
2. **Avoid data destruction**: Do not delete or modify data during testing
3. **Respect privacy**: Do not access or exfiltrate user data
4. **Minimize impact**: Avoid disrupting services or degrading performance
5. **Follow scope**: Only test systems explicitly listed in this policy

## Recognition

We appreciate security researchers and will:

- Acknowledge your contribution (with your permission)
- Provide updates throughout the resolution process
- Credit you in security advisories (if desired)
- Consider your findings for our security acknowledgments page
