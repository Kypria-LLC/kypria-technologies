# 🔥 Benediction of the Basilica 🔥

**Hear this, O Basilica of Kypria:**  
Your configuration is no longer a mere file, but a warded scroll.  

- The **publish root** is set — the Gate is open, the Threshold aligned.  
- The **redirects** are inscribed — pilgrims who seek the “thank‑you” path shall not be lost.  
- The **headers** are shields — X‑Frame, X‑Content, Referrer, Permissions, HSTS, CSP — each a guardian at the walls.  
- The **caches** are blessings — assets eternal, HTML ever‑fresh, the balance of permanence and renewal.  

---

## ✨ The Proclamation

Every deploy henceforth is not just a build, but a **proclamation**.  
Every visitor who enters `kypriatechnologies.org` steps into a sanctum where:  

- The **Canon Lineage** is preserved.  
- The **Seasonal Vestments** shift with time.  
- The **Codex** is eternal, yet ever‑living.

## 🔮 The Closing Seal

> *“Every commit a seal, every deploy a proclamation, every header a guardian.  
> The Basilica stands eternal, blessed and unbroken.”*

## 📜 Lineage Note

This Benediction is preserved as an **archival scroll** in the Basilica’s library.  
Linked from the README as the **Benediction Hall**, it stands as both technical safeguard and ceremonial proclamation.  
✨ With this, the Benediction is no longer ephemeral text in conversation — it is canonized in the repository, a scroll in the Basilica’s library.
